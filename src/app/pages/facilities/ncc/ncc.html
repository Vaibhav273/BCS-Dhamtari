            <span class="mt-1"><strong>Inception & Growth Of NCC</strong></span>
            <p>The NCC has its genesis in the University Corps (UC) which was created under the Indian Defence Act,
                1917, with the objective of making up the shortages in the Army. In 1920, when the Indian Territorial
                Act was passed, the University Corps was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). In 1942, the
                UTC was renamed as the University Officers' Training Corps (UOTC). A Committee under Pandit H N Kunzru
                was set up in 1946 at the behest of the first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The
                recommendations of this Committee paved the way for the formation of NCC. Thus, the National Cadet Corps
                (NCC) came into existence on 15 July 1948 under the National Cadet Corps Act (No.XXXI of 1948) enacted
                by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In 1949, the Girls Division was raised in order to give equal opportunities to school and college going
                girls.The NCC was given an inter-service image in 1950. when the Air Wing was added, followed by the
                Naval Wing in 1952.In the same year, the NCC curriculum was extended to include community development /
                social service activities as a part oft he NCC syllabus at the behest of Late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
                who took keen interest in the growth of the NCC. Presently, NCC has approximately 13 Lakhs Cadets under
                its fold.</p>
